This page contains data for all General Observer (GO) and Guaranteed
Time Observations (GTO), and Cool Catalog Target (CCT).

For each proposal cycle (AO stands for Announcement of Opportunity),
there's a table showing, for each instrumet/grating combination, the
number of obsids, the percentage of total obsids, the exposure time for
those observations, and the percentage of the total time. The first column
shows the AO number.

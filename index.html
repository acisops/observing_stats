<P>This complex of web pages contains proposal statistics derived
from data extracted from the OBSCAT. There are three cases
considered:

</p><p>
<ul>
<li> <a href=all_allyears.html>All observations</a> (CAL+GO+GTO+DDT+TOO+CCT)</li>
<li> <a href=nocal_allyears.html>No-CAL observations</a> (GO+GTO+DDT+TOO+CCT)</li>
<li> <a href=ggto_allyears.html>GO & GTO observations</a> (GO+GTO+CCT)</li>
<li> <a href=wip_allyears.html>GO & GTO observations</a> (GO+GTO+CCT incl. unobserved)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<P>Note the data were extracted from the obscat on the date given at
the top of the html page.</p>

<P>The statistics quoted here are for completed observations, and
those in the short-term schedule as of the date indicated. This
specifically excludes those with status canceled, unobserved, or
untriggered. Presumably older AO programs are essentially complete,
but the latest one is still very much in progress.
</p>

<P>There are also plots of the percentage of proposals and exposure time
spent in each instrument/grating combination.</p>

<P>In Jan 2019, I added Cool Catalog Targets to the statistics.</p>
